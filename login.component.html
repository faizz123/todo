                Gone are the days of waiting for months to receive a letter from your friend or relative residing in a distant place. At the click of some buttons you can talk to anyone sitting in a remote part of the world. Earlier people used to flock to library for research work or pleasure reading which has now been replaced with e books and search engines.
                
                
                 
                 
                
                Some 100 years back, people could not predict the incoming hurricane, its position and time of attack but now anyone with a mobile phone can find these details and interpret it accurately. The outdoor activities have now been replaced with computers and Play Station. Now a days, kids prefer spending time on what their virtual friends are up to rather than spending quality time with their family or friends.
                
                Technology is advancing with a speed of light making it difficult to cope up with. It has transformed our lives and has turned the world into a global village.

                PARAGRAPH ON TECHNOLOGY 4 (250 WORDS)
                Mankind has used technology to explore and discover the mysteries of nature and its existence. In that quest, technology has also managed to bring luxuries and comfort to our daily lives. Technology has helped scientists to peek into the dark space, explore the world of gadgets, test the powers of nuclear energy and discover the undiscovered.
                
                Everyday scientists are exploring ways to exploit solar energy, wind energy and harnessing power from it, converting salty ocean water to pure fresh water, predicting climatic conditions and much more. New technologies are coming up to intricately study the lives of different species whom we know very little about. Technological efforts are being made to preserve endanger species and produce better and healthy crops by genetically modifying them.
                
                Technology must be Used Wisely
                
                However, technology can become a reason for self-destruction if not used decisively. Thus, it becomes very important to strike a balance between technology and nature, as technology knows no limit and can turn disparaging. A lot of E-waste is generated because of the excessive use of smart phones, televisions and so many other electronics.
                
                These E-wastes are getting dumped onto fields polluting the land and a lot of natural resources are wasted. Nuclear energy and biological warfare are a threat to the nature as it has long lasting and destructive effects to the environment. Manufacturing of modern day technologies, cars and industries have resulted in air, water and land pollution which has resulted in alarming situations of climate change and global warming.
                
                Conclusion
                
                To decide whether technology is a friend to the mankind or an enemy solely depends upon the user.
